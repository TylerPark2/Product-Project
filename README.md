# AI-Powered Memory Weaver

## 1. Problem Definition and User Research (25 points)

### 🧠 Problem Statement
Many people struggle to preserve and reflect on meaningful life moments in a way that feels effortless, emotionally resonant, and private. Existing tools like journaling apps require active input, which feels time-consuming, while social media and photo albums often lack depth or compromise privacy. There’s no intuitive solution that passively captures daily experiences—such as conversations, emotions, or environments—and transforms them into curated, personal stories that help users relive joy, strengthen connections, or maintain memories over time.

- **Easy to use**: Passive data collection + simple app interface = accessibility for all.

### 🎯 Target Audience

- **Secondary**: Seniors (60+), especially those with memory concerns or legacy goals.
- **Tertiary**: Gift-givers or therapists looking to support reflection and storytelling.
- **Demographics**: Urban/suburban users, moderate to high income, tech-comfortable, emotionally attuned, privacy-focused.
